## 10. Implementation Patterns

### Data Fetching Pattern
```typescript
// Example: +page.server.ts
export const load = async ({ params, fetch }) => {
  const portfolioData = await fetch('/api/investor/portfolio');
  const watchlistData = await fetch('/api/investor/watchlist');
  const recommendedStartups = await fetch('/api/investor/recommendations');
  
  return {
    portfolio: portfolioData.json(),
    watchlist: watchlistData.json(),
    recommendations: recommendedStartups.json()
  };
};
```

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Example: portfolioManager.ts
class PortfolioManager {
  holdings = $state([]);
  metrics = $state({
    totalInvested: 0,
    currentValue: 0,
    returnMultiple: 0
  });
  
  async loadPortfolio() {
    // Implementation
  }
  
  calculateMetrics() {
    // Implementation
  }
}

export const portfolioManager = new PortfolioManager();
```

### Component Pattern
```svelte
<!-- Example: PortfolioCard.svelte -->
<script lang="ts">
  import { formatCurrency } from '$lib/utils';
  import { Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardContent } from '$lib/components/ui/card';
  
  let { startup, investment, currentValue, returnMultiple } = $props();
</script>

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>{startup.name}</CardTitle>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div class="grid gap-2">
      <div class="flex justify-between">
        <span class="text-muted-foreground">Invested</span>
        <span>{formatCurrency(investment)}</span>
      </div>
      <div class="flex justify-between">
        <span class="text-muted-foreground">Current Value</span>
        <span>{formatCurrency(currentValue)}</span>
      </div>
      <div class="flex justify-between">
        <span class="text-muted-foreground">Return</span>
        <span class={returnMultiple > 1 ? "text-investment-positive" : "text-investment-negative"}>
          {returnMultiple.toFixed(2)}x
        </span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```
