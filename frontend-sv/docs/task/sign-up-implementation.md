# Sign-Up and Onboarding Flow Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the sign-up and onboarding flow for the StartupConnect platform, which allows users to register and complete an onboarding process to set up their profiles and preferences.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Onboarding State Management
- **File**: `src/lib/hooks/onboarding-state.svelte.ts`
- Implements a reactive state management system for the onboarding process
- Tracks current step, form data, and visited steps
- Provides methods for navigation and data updates

### 2. Onboarding Schema Validation
- **File**: `src/lib/schemas/onboarding-schema.ts`
- Defines Zod schemas for validating onboarding data
- Includes schemas for role selection, basic info, goals, skills, and preferences

### 3. Onboarding Routes
- **Directory**: `src/routes/onboarding/`
- Contains all onboarding step routes:
  - Welcome (`/onboarding`)
  - Role Selection (`/onboarding/role-selection`)
  - Basic Info (`/onboarding/basic-info`)
  - Goals (`/onboarding/goals`)
  - Skills (`/onboarding/skills`)
  - Preferences (`/onboarding/preferences`)
  - Review (`/onboarding/review`)
  - Completion (`/onboarding/completion`)

### 4. API Endpoint
- **File**: `src/routes/api/onboarding/+server.ts`
- Handles onboarding completion and data submission
- Validates data and processes user role updates

### 5. Dashboards
- **Files**: 
  - `src/routes/dashboard/+page.svelte`
  - `src/routes/founder-dashboard/+page.svelte`
  - `src/routes/investor-dashboard/+page.svelte`
  - `src/routes/support-dashboard/+page.svelte`
- Role-specific dashboards for post-onboarding navigation

## Flow Description

### 1. Registration
- User visits `/register` and fills out the registration form
- Upon successful registration, user is redirected to `/onboarding`

### 2. Onboarding Steps
1. **Welcome**: Introduction to the onboarding process
2. **Role Selection**: User chooses between Founder, Investor, or Support roles
3. **Basic Information**: User provides personal details
4. **Goals**: User sets personal and platform goals
5. **Skills**: User selects relevant skills
6. **Preferences**: User sets communication and notification preferences
7. **Review**: User reviews all provided information
8. **Completion**: Onboarding data is submitted and user is redirected to role-specific dashboard

### 3. Post-Onboarding
- User is redirected to their role-specific dashboard:
  - Founders → `/founder-dashboard`
  - Investors → `/investor-dashboard`
  - Support → `/support-dashboard`
  - Default → `/dashboard`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication
- Uses Better-Auth for user authentication
- Default role is set to "user" during registration
- Role is updated during onboarding completion

### Data Validation
- Uses Zod schemas for client-side and server-side validation
- Ensures data integrity throughout the onboarding process

### State Persistence
- Onboarding progress is stored in reactive state
- State persists during the onboarding session

### Responsive Design
- All components are mobile-responsive
- Follows modern UI/UX best practices

## Security Considerations
- Only authenticated users can access onboarding routes
- API endpoints validate session before processing data
- Data is validated both client-side and server-side

## Future Enhancements
- Persist onboarding progress to database for continuation after refresh
- Add more detailed profile setup for each role type
- Implement email verification during registration
- Add analytics tracking for onboarding completion rates
