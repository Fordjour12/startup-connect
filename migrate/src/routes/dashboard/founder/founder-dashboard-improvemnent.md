    raised: 2500000,
    investors: [],
    documents: []
  });
  
  metrics = $derived({
    percentComplete: (this.currentRound.raised / this.currentRound.target) * 100,
    averageInvestment: this.currentRound.investors.length > 0 
      ? this.currentRound.raised / this.currentRound.investors.length 
      : 0
  });
  
  addInvestment(investor, amount) {
    this.currentRound.raised += amount;
    this.currentRound.investors.push({
      name: investor,
      amount,
      date: new Date()
    });
  }
  
  resetRound(newTarget) {
    this.currentRound = {
      target: newTarget,
      raised: 0,
      investors: [],
      documents: []
    };
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization

```typescript
// Example: Improved data fetching with SvelteKit
export const load = async ({ fetch, depends }) => {
  depends('dashboard:metrics');
  
  const [metricsResponse, investorsResponse, tasksResponse] = await Promise.all([
    fetch('/api/metrics'),
    fetch('/api/investors'),
    fetch('/api/tasks')
  ]);
  
  if (!metricsResponse.ok) {
    throw error(metricsResponse.status, 'Failed to load metrics');
  }
  
  return {
    metrics: await metricsResponse.json(),
    investors: investorsResponse.ok ? await investorsResponse.json() : [],
    tasks: tasksResponse.ok ? await tasksResponse.json() : []
  };
};
```

<script lang="ts">
  import { formatCurrency, formatNumber, formatPercent } from '$lib/utils';
  import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from '$lib/components/ui/card';
  import TrendingUp from "@lucide/svelte/icons/trending-up";
  import TrendingDown from "@lucide/svelte/icons/trending-down";
  import InfoTooltip from './InfoTooltip.svelte';
  
  let { 
    title, 
    value, 
    percentChange = null, 
    changeText = '',
    type = 'number',
    tooltipText = '',
    history = []
  } = $props();
  
  // Format the value based on its type
  $derived displayValue = {
    if (type === 'currency') {
      return formatCurrency(value);
    } else if (type === 'percent') {
      return formatPercent(value);
    } else {
      return formatNumber(value);
    }
  };
  
  // Determine trend direction
  $derived trend = percentChange > 0 ? 'up' : percentChange < 0 ? 'down' : 'neutral';
  
  // Generate sparkline from history data if available
  let sparklinePath = $derived(() => {
    if (!history || history.length < 2) return '';
    return generateSparkline(history, 30, 80);
  });
  
  function generateSparkline(data, height, width) {
    // Sparkline generation logic...
  }
</script>

<Card>
  <CardHeader class="pb-2">
    <div class="flex items-center justify-between">
      <CardTitle class="text-sm font-medium">{title}</CardTitle>
      {#if tooltipText}
        <InfoTooltip text={tooltipText} />
      {/if}
    </div>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
      <div class="flex items-baseline justify-between">
        <span class="text-2xl font-bold">{displayValue}</span>
        {#if history.length > 1}
          <svg width="80" height="30" class="opacity-70">
            <path d={sparklinePath} fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" />
          </svg>
        {/if}
      </div>
      
      {#if percentChange !== null}
        <div class="flex items-center gap-1 text-xs">
          <span class={trend === 'up' ? 'text-green-500' : trend === 'down' ? 'text-red-500' : ''}>
            {#if trend === 'up'}
              <TrendingUp class="h-3 w-3" />
            {:else if trend === 'down'}
              <TrendingDown class="h-3 w-3" />
            {/if}
            {Math.abs(percentChange)}%
          </span>
          {#if changeText}
            <span class="text-muted-foreground">{changeText}</span>
          {/if}
        </div>
      {/if}
    </div>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```
