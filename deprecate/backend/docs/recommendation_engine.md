# Investor Recommendation Engine Documentation

## Overview

The Investor Recommendation Engine is an intelligent matching system that analyzes startup profiles and recommends the most suitable investors based on multiple criteria. This system was implemented as part of PH-20 to provide personalized investor recommendations for founders.

## Algorithm Design

### Core Principles

The recommendation algorithm uses a weighted scoring system that evaluates multiple factors to determine investor-startup compatibility:

1. **Industry Alignment** (40% weight) - Most important factor
2. **Funding Stage Match** (30% weight) - Very important
3. **Location Proximity** (15% weight) - Moderately important  
4. **Funding Amount Compatibility** (10% weight) - Less important
5. **Profile Completeness Bonus** (5% weight) - Encourages complete profiles

### Scoring Methodology

Each investor receives a score from 0-100 based on how well they match the founder's startup profile. The final score is calculated as:

```
Final Score = (Industry Score Ã— 0.4) + 
              (Stage Score Ã— 0.3) + 
              (Location Score Ã— 0.15) + 
              (Funding Score Ã— 0.1) + 
              (Completeness Score Ã— 0.05)
```

## Scoring Criteria Details

### 1. Industry Match (40% weight)

**Perfect Match (100%)**
- Investor's `investment_focus` explicitly includes the startup's industry

**Related Match (70%)**
- Investor focuses on industries related to the startup's industry
- Related industry mappings:
  - Technology â†” FinTech, HealthTech, EdTech
  - FinTech â†” Technology, Finance
  - HealthTech â†” Technology, Healthcare, Biotechnology
  - Biotechnology â†” Healthcare, HealthTech

**No Match (0%)**
- No industry alignment found

### 2. Funding Stage Match (30% weight)

**Perfect Match (100%)**
- Investor's `preferred_stages` explicitly includes the startup's current stage

**Adjacent Match (60%)**
- Investor invests in stages adjacent to the startup's stage
- Stage progression: Idea â†’ MVP â†’ Pre-seed â†’ Seed â†’ Series A â†’ Series B â†’ Series C

**No Preference (50%)**
- Investor hasn't specified stage preferences (neutral score)

**No Match (0%)**
- No stage alignment found

### 3. Location Proximity (15% weight)

**Same Location (100%)**
- Exact location match between investor and startup

**Compatible Region (70%)**
- Same metropolitan area or region (e.g., Bay Area, NYC)

**Different Region (20%)**
- Different geographic regions (small penalty for remote relationships)

**Missing Data (30%)**
- Neutral score when location information is incomplete

### 4. Funding Amount Compatibility (10% weight)

**Typical Range (100%)**
- Startup's funding goal fits typical investment ranges for their stage:
  - Pre-seed: $50K - $500K
  - Seed: $250K - $2M
  - Series A: $1M - $15M
  - Series B: $5M - $50M

**Outside Range (60%)**
- Funding goal outside typical ranges (neutral score)

### 5. Profile Completeness Bonus (5% weight)

**Calculation**
- Required fields (80% weight): name, description, industry, funding_stage, location
- Optional fields (20% weight): funding_goal, business_model, target_market

**Score = (Required Completeness Ã— 0.8) + (Optional Completeness Ã— 0.2)**

## Confidence Levels

Recommendations are categorized by confidence level based on overall score:

- **High Confidence**: Score â‰¥ 80
- **Medium Confidence**: Score 60-79
- **Low Confidence**: Score < 60

## Usage Examples

### Basic Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.startupconnect.com/api/me/recommendations" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Customized Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.startupconnect.com/api/me/recommendations?max_results=5&min_score=70" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
const getRecommendations = async (options = {}) => {
  const params = new URLSearchParams({
    max_results: options.maxResults || 10,
    min_score: options.minScore || 30.0
  });
  
  const response = await fetch(`/api/me/recommendations?${params}`, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch recommendations');
  }
  
  return response.json();
};

// Usage
const recommendations = await getRecommendations({
  maxResults: 15,
  minScore: 50.0
});

console.log(`Found ${recommendations.recommendations.length} recommendations`);
recommendations.recommendations.forEach(rec => {
  console.log(`${rec.investor.name}: ${rec.score}% match`);
  rec.reasons.forEach(reason => {
    console.log(`  - ${reason.description}`);
  });
});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Caching**: Cache investor profiles and startup data to reduce database queries
2. **Indexing**: Ensure proper database indexes on frequently queried fields
3. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple recommendations in batches for efficiency
4. **Lazy Loading**: Load detailed investor data only for top recommendations

### Expected Performance

- **Response Time**: < 500ms for typical requests
- **Throughput**: 100+ requests per second
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB for recommendation engine instance
- **Database Queries**: 2-3 queries per recommendation request

## Error Handling

### Common Error Responses

**403 Forbidden**
```json
{
  "detail": "Only founders can access investor recommendations"
}
```

**404 Not Found**
```json
{
  "detail": "No startup profile found for user"
}
```

**500 Internal Server Error**
```json
{
  "detail": "Failed to generate recommendations: [error details]"
}
```
