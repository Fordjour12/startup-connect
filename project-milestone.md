## Technical Notes

### Database Schema
- Users: email, password, role (startup/supporter/investor)
- Startups: name, description, industry, location, funding_goal, funding_stage
- Messages: sender, recipient, content, timestamp
- Relationships: User -> Startup (founder), User -> Message (sender/recipient)

### API Endpoints
- Authentication: /auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/me
- Startups: /startups, /startups/{id}, /startups/create
- Messages: /messages, /messages/{id}, /messages/send
- Admin: /admin/users, /admin/startups, /admin/analytics

### Security Considerations
- JWT-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control
- Input validation with Pydantic
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (to be implemented)

### Performance Optimizations
- Database indexing
- Caching strategy (to be implemented)
- Pagination for listings
- File upload optimization
- Real-time updates with WebSocket

## Next Steps
1. Complete startup CRUD operations
2. Implement file upload system
3. Add search and filter functionality
4. Begin frontend development
5. Set up testing infrastructure
